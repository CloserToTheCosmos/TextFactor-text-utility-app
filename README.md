<h1>My First React Project</h1>
<p>This was definetly hard on the first day but as time passed by I got the hang of it. I love react and the fact that it I can build multiple paged websites and make switching between them seamless is great. I would love to continue using react and build greater things such as my Poftfolio Website V2.0</p>
